# deadCellsRandomBuildGenerator

A simple Python program I wrote to generate a build you can either aim to create in Normal mode or simply run in Custom mode.
Dead Cells isn't really a game that NEEDS a randomizer since the point of the game (at least on Normal) is to work with whatever the game gives you (which is, in itself, random).
I made this because I am insanely bored and have played this game to absolute death and wanted to practice a little coding. So it's for all the other freaks like me out there who have also played the game to death and wanna let RNG play an even LARGER role in your gameplay. Idk. Whatever.
